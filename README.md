# TextInNotepad (TIN)
Simple FUD windows malware written in python 3.9. TIN is a small malware that I wrote which will lock your keyboard and mouse pointer, and type text into notepad. TIN is made for Windows 10. TIN is essentially not a complete and foolproof malware. You can use TIN to create other stronger malwares but TIN is intentionally not moulded into a definite malware.

### Go to the `Releases` section to get the final malware

**Known issues** - User can still click with mouse which _may_ cause intereference with the script, user can also press `ctrl`+`alt`+`del` which also _can_ interfere with the script, however, the system will shutdown if the user attempts to use task manager to kill the program. Testing was done only on Admin account, program _may_ perform differently on a regular user account.<br><br>If you have solutions to these issues and are interested in contribution, do raise a PR.
