# TextInNotepad (TIN)
Simple FUD windows malware written in python 3.9. TIN is a small malware that I wrote which will lock your keyboard and mouse and type text into notepad. TIN is made for Windows 10. TIN is essentially not a complete and foolproof malware. You can use TIN to create ransomware or other stronger malwares but TIN is intentionally not moulded into a definite malware.
